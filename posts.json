In this post, I explore how to build force-directed graphs.\n\n```javascript\nconst simulation = d3.forceSimulation(nodes)\n    .force(\"link\", d3.forceLink(links))\n    .force(\"charge\", d3.forceManyBody())\n    .force(\"center\", d3.forceCenter());\n```\n\nThe key is understanding how forces interact to create the layout.",
